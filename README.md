# RickOwens HTML CSS JS

## Requirements

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)

After installing Node, run the code below from the command line to install sass  <br>

## How to contribute to the project
You'll be given a task to perform in the form of the pages to write code for.  
Every page requires HTML and CSS. To write HTML for any page, just create a .html file for the page . 

The HTML files live inside the root folder. Do not create any new folder!  
The CSS files live inside the css folder inside the root folder. You write new CSS by creating a new .css file and importing into the main style.scss file.  

You'll write your CSS using the SCSS syntax.

The project contains many sample HTML and CSS files as a guide.

## File naming convention and Coding style should be followed

## A simple way to write some SCSS for this project

1. First from your command line, navigate to the root folder of the project on your system.
2. Make sure you import your own scss file in the style.scss file
3. With [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) installed, type:   
`sass --watch css/style.scss css/style.css`
4. Start editing your scss files and the sass engine will automatically compile and make the styles available to the project.
